**Using the `OpenGraph` component**

The `OpenGraph` component simply takes the origin of your site as a prop, and a `DynamicImage` component as its child:

```tsx
export const Component = () => {
  return (
    <OpenGraph origin='https://example.com'>
      <DynamicImage>
        <div>This is very cool!</div>
      </DynamicImage>
    </OpenGraph>
  )
}
```
